Hey, I'm **Archie**! This is my GitHub profile. There's not a huge amount of activity here because I usually develop my own projects on a [Gitea](https://gitea.io) instance that I host myself, but I've uploaded a bunch of projects I've worked on in the past here.

### Things I use
I've been using React, Next.js and Vite on the frontend, usually with Tailwind CSS. I've used Node.js a lot in the past and Deno a bit, but lately I prefer Go for backend stuff. I have a lot of experience using Stripe for payment processing. I usually host projects on my own Linux server because I enjoy the experience of everything breaking periodically, but I use cloud services like Vercel sometimes.

### What I'm working on
- When I was younger, I used to spend most of my time developing a collection of projects under a brand I called Alles, which included a [social site similar to Twitter](https://github.com/xkcdstickfigure/micro), [a search engine](https://github.com/xkcdstickfigure/bing) based on the Bing API, and [various](https://github.com/xkcdstickfigure/pulsar) [neat](https://github.com/xkcdstickfigure/tab-home) [little](https://github.com/xkcdstickfigure/verdaccio-api-auth) [utilities](https://github.com/xkcdstickfigure/mcauth) that integrated with your account, with hundreds of awesome people in the community. I was developing it very publicly and almost everything was open-source at the time.
- More recently, I've made [a site for creating wikis](https://github.com/xkcdstickfigure/wiki) for games or tv shows (similar to fandom.com) and a [publishing site](https://github.com/xkcdstickfigure/write.cx).
- Right now, I'm working on a few very cool projects, but I'm not such a public person nowadays, so you'll have to talk to me if you want to know about them :)

### Other stuff I do
- I play piano, and compose music sometimes
- I cycle for an hour every day
- I like reading obscure pages on Wikipedia

### Contact me
I don't really use platforms like Twitter anymore, but if you want to talk, send me an email: archie@abaer.dev
